## Key Decisions Made
- **2025-01-13:** ASP.NET Core 8.0 chosen as primary framework - Rationale: Business requirement for Windows environment - Decided by: Human/Claude Code
- **2025-01-13:** Multi-agent development approach with detailed handoff logging - Rationale: Solo development with AI assistance coordination - Decided by: Human/Claude Code
