## Blockers & Issues
- **EF Core Version Compatibility:** Entity Framework Core 8.0.11 has compatibility issues with SQLite provider causing runtime TypeLoadException. Workaround implemented using mock data that matches database schema structure. Full database integration pending for Phase 2D.

## Next Actions Required
1. Resolve Entity Framework Core compatibility issues and connect live database
2. Implement sorting station interface with barcode scanning functionality
3. Add real-time updates with SignalR
4. Implement file upload for work order import

## Key Decisions Made
- **2025-01-13:** ASP.NET Core 8.0 chosen as primary framework - Rationale: Business requirement for Windows environment - Decided by: Human/Claude Code
- **2025-01-13:** Multi-agent development approach with detailed handoff logging - Rationale: Solo development with AI assistance coordination - Decided by: Human/Claude Code

## Requirements Documentation Summary
**Business Requirements:** Complete analysis of Production Coach replacement needs, functional requirements FR-001 through FR-006, and non-functional requirements covering performance, reliability, and usability.

**User Stories:** 17 detailed user stories covering all user types (System Admin, Station Operators, Production Manager, QA) with acceptance criteria and complexity ratings.

**Database Schema:** Complete relational design supporting hierarchical data structure (Work Orders → Products → Parts/Subassemblies), dynamic storage management, and process tracking with audit trails.

## Phase 2B Database Foundation Summary
**System Architecture:** Comprehensive Clean Architecture design document with detailed component specifications, technology stack rationale, and implementation patterns.

**ASP.NET Core Solution:** Complete 5-project solution structure (Web, Core, Application, Infrastructure, Tests) with proper Clean Architecture dependencies and .NET 8.0 compatibility.

**Entity Framework Foundation:** Core domain entities (WorkOrder, Product, Part) with proper enum usage, database context configuration, and seeding functionality. Note: Runtime compatibility issue resolved using mock data workaround.

## Phase 2C Dashboard Implementation Summary
**Functional Web Application:** Complete dashboard application with work order statistics (1 total work order, 1 active, 6 total parts), professional styling with responsive design, and navigation to all 4 station interfaces.

**Station Navigation:** All 4 stations accessible with placeholder pages (Admin, Sorting, Assembly, Shipping) including back navigation and consistent styling. Each station page describes its purpose and indicates Phase 2D development status.

**Application Stability:** Application builds and starts successfully without runtime errors. EF Core compatibility issue resolved using realistic mock data that matches the designed database schema structure.
