## Blockers & Issues
- **EF Core Version Compatibility:** Entity Framework Core 8.0.11 has compatibility issues with SQLite provider causing runtime TypeLoadException. This will need to be resolved in Phase 2C by using a different approach or alternative package versions.

## Next Actions Required
1. Resolve Entity Framework Core compatibility issues
2. Implement basic station interfaces (Sorting station priority)
3. Create Razor Pages structure for all stations
4. Add SignalR for real-time updates

## Key Decisions Made
- **2025-01-13:** ASP.NET Core 8.0 chosen as primary framework - Rationale: Business requirement for Windows environment - Decided by: Human/Claude Code
- **2025-01-13:** Multi-agent development approach with detailed handoff logging - Rationale: Solo development with AI assistance coordination - Decided by: Human/Claude Code

## Requirements Documentation Summary
**Business Requirements:** Complete analysis of Production Coach replacement needs, functional requirements FR-001 through FR-006, and non-functional requirements covering performance, reliability, and usability.

**User Stories:** 17 detailed user stories covering all user types (System Admin, Station Operators, Production Manager, QA) with acceptance criteria and complexity ratings.

**Database Schema:** Complete relational design supporting hierarchical data structure (Work Orders → Products → Parts/Subassemblies), dynamic storage management, and process tracking with audit trails.

## Phase 2B Database Foundation Summary
**System Architecture:** Comprehensive Clean Architecture design document with detailed component specifications, technology stack rationale, and implementation patterns.

**ASP.NET Core Solution:** Complete 5-project solution structure (Web, Core, Application, Infrastructure, Tests) with proper Clean Architecture dependencies and .NET 8.0 compatibility.

**Entity Framework Foundation:** Core domain entities (WorkOrder, Product, Part) with proper enum usage, database context configuration, and seeding functionality. Note: Runtime compatibility issue identified for resolution in Phase 2C.
