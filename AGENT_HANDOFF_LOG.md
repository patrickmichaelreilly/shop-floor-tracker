## 2025-01-13 - Claude Code (Phase 2B: Database Foundation)
**Work Completed:**
- Created comprehensive system architecture document using Clean Architecture patterns
- Developed detailed technical specifications for ASP.NET Core 8.0 implementation
- Set up complete 5-project solution structure (Web, Core, Application, Infrastructure, Tests)
- Implemented Entity Framework Core foundation with domain entities and enums
- Created database context with proper relationship configuration and enum conversions
- Built database seeding functionality with sample work order data
- Established proper Clean Architecture dependency flow and project references

**Files Created/Modified:**
- docs/design/system-architecture.md - Complete Clean Architecture design with component specifications
- docs/design/technical-specifications.md - Detailed implementation guidelines and patterns
- src/ShopFloorTracker.sln - Solution file with all project references
- src/ShopFloorTracker.Core/* - Domain entities (WorkOrder, Product, Part) with enums and relationships
- src/ShopFloorTracker.Infrastructure/Data/* - EF Core context, configuration, and database seeding
- src/ShopFloorTracker.Web/Program.cs - Basic ASP.NET Core setup (EF integration commented out due to version issue)
- PROJECT_STATUS.md - Updated to 60% completion, Phase 2B complete

**Issues Created:**
- None yet (GitHub remote setup still pending)

**Next Agent Should:**
- **PRIORITY 1:** Resolve Entity Framework Core 8.0.11 compatibility issue with SQLite provider (TypeLoadException on LockReleaseBehavior)
- **PRIORITY 2:** Implement Sorting Station interface (highest business value per user stories)
- Create basic Razor Pages structure for all 4 stations
- Add SignalR configuration for real-time updates
- Implement repository pattern interfaces and concrete implementations

**Blockers/Questions:**
- **CRITICAL:** EF Core SQLite provider compatibility issue preventing database initialization
- GitHub remote repository setup still needed for issue tracking
- Decision on specific UI components and styling framework for station interfaces

**Key Insights for Next Agent:**
- Solution builds successfully and ASP.NET Core starts correctly (tested with simplified Program.cs)
- All domain entities properly configured with enum support and relationship mapping
- Database seeding creates realistic sample data (1 work order, 2 products, 6 parts)
- Clean Architecture structure enables easy testing and future extension
- EF Core issue likely requires package version alignment or alternative approach

**Technical Notes:**
- All projects target .NET 8.0 with proper dependency flow
- Entity enums use string conversion for database storage
- Sample data represents realistic kitchen cabinet manufacturing workflow
- Database context configured for both SQLite (dev) and SQL Server (prod) support

**Time Spent:** 2 hours

## 2025-01-13 - Claude Code (Requirements Documentation)
**Work Completed:**
- Created comprehensive business requirements document (FR-001 through FR-006)
- Developed 17 detailed user stories covering all station workflows and user types
- Designed complete acceptance criteria with testable specifications
- Created initial database schema supporting hierarchical data structure
- Updated project status to reflect 40% completion of requirements phase

**Files Created/Modified:**
- docs/requirements/business-requirements.md - Complete functional and non-functional requirements
- docs/requirements/user-stories.md - User stories for System Admin, Station Operators, Production Manager, QA
- docs/requirements/acceptance-criteria.md - Detailed testable criteria for all functional requirements
- docs/design/database-schema.sql - Complete relational schema with indexes, views, and initial data
- PROJECT_STATUS.md - Updated to reflect requirements documentation completion

**Issues Created:**
- None yet (GitHub remote setup still pending)

**Next Agent Should:**
- Design system architecture document covering ASP.NET Core structure
- Create detailed technical specifications for each station interface
- Set up initial ASP.NET Core 8.0 project structure in src/ directory
- Implement database initialization and Entity Framework setup
- Create basic project scaffolding with dependency injection and configuration

**Blockers/Questions:**
- GitHub remote repository setup still needed for issue tracking and collaboration
- Decision needed on specific UI framework (Razor Pages vs Blazor vs MVC)
- Authentication/authorization strategy needs definition

**Key Insights for Next Agent:**
- Sorting station workflow is highest business priority (US-004, US-005)
- Storage rack flexibility is major improvement opportunity (unlimited vs current 6-rack limit)
- Database schema emphasizes audit trail and hierarchical data integrity
- All 4 stations need different interface contexts but shared data model

**Time Spent:** 2 hours

## 2025-01-13 - Claude Code (Initial Setup)
**Work Completed:**
- Initialized git repository
- Created complete directory structure for multi-agent development
- Set up core documentation framework (README, PROJECT_STATUS, this handoff log)
- Created GitHub issue templates for structured development
- Established agent coordination protocols

**Files Created/Modified:**
- README.md - Project overview and quick navigation
- PROJECT_STATUS.md - Current status dashboard
- AGENT_HANDOFF_LOG.md - This coordination log
- Complete directory structure per specifications
- GitHub issue templates for user stories, bugs, and tasks

**Issues Created:**
- None yet (waiting for GitHub remote setup)

**Next Agent Should:**
- Populate business-requirements.md with specific Production Coach replacement needs
- Create initial user stories based on shop floor tracking requirements
- Begin database schema design for part tracking workflow

**Blockers/Questions:**
- Need specific business requirements from existing Production Coach usage
- GitHub remote repository setup needed for issue tracking

**Time Spent:** 30 minutes
