- Implemented complete dashboard interface with work order statistics and professional styling
- Created navigation system linking to all 4 station interfaces (Admin, Sorting, Assembly, Shipping)
- Built responsive web design with modern UI components and consistent branding
- Established functional web application that builds and starts without runtime errors
- Verified application stability and user interface functionality

**Files Created/Modified:**
- src/ShopFloorTracker.Web/Program.cs - Complete dashboard implementation with mock data and station navigation
- PROJECT_STATUS.md - Updated to 75% completion, Phase 2C complete with application stability notes

**Issues Created:**
- None yet (GitHub remote setup still pending)

**Next Agent Should:**
- **PRIORITY 1:** Resolve Entity Framework Core SQLite compatibility and connect live database
- **PRIORITY 2:** Implement Sorting Station interface with barcode scanning and rack assignment
- Add real-time updates using SignalR for live data synchronization across stations
- Implement file upload functionality for Microvellum CSV import on Admin station
- Create part tracking workflow with status updates between stations

**Blockers/Questions:**
- EF Core SQLite provider TypeLoadException still unresolved (workaround implemented)
- GitHub remote repository setup needed for issue tracking and collaboration
- Barcode scanner hardware integration requirements need definition

**Key Insights for Next Agent:**
- Dashboard successfully displays mock data that matches database schema structure exactly
- All station pages accessible with proper navigation and consistent styling
- Application architecture proven stable - ready for feature development
- Mock data represents realistic cabinet manufacturing workflow (John Smith Kitchen, 2 products, 6 parts)
- UI design professional and touch-friendly for shop floor use

**Technical Notes:**
- Mock data structure: 1 work order "240613-Smith Kitchen" with 1 active status
- Dashboard shows: Total Work Orders (1), Active Work Orders (1), Total Parts (6)
- All 4 station pages include back navigation and Phase 2D status indicators
- Application uses minimal APIs with HTML string responses for simplicity
- Modern CSS styling with cards, flexbox layout, and professional color scheme

**Time Spent:** 45 minutes

## 2025-01-13 - Claude Code (Phase 2B: Database Foundation)
**Work Completed:**
- Created comprehensive system architecture document using Clean Architecture patterns
- Developed detailed technical specifications for ASP.NET Core 8.0 implementation
- Set up complete 5-project solution structure (Web, Core, Application, Infrastructure, Tests)
- Implemented Entity Framework Core foundation with domain entities and enums
- Created database context with proper relationship configuration and enum conversions
- Built database seeding functionality with sample work order data
- Established proper Clean Architecture dependency flow and project references

**Files Created/Modified:**
- docs/design/system-architecture.md - Complete Clean Architecture design with component specifications
- docs/design/technical-specifications.md - Detailed implementation guidelines and patterns
- src/ShopFloorTracker.sln - Solution file with all project references
- src/ShopFloorTracker.Core/* - Domain entities (WorkOrder, Product, Part) with enums and relationships
- src/ShopFloorTracker.Infrastructure/Data/* - EF Core context, configuration, and database seeding
- src/ShopFloorTracker.Web/Program.cs - Basic ASP.NET Core setup (EF integration commented out due to version issue)
- PROJECT_STATUS.md - Updated to 60% completion, Phase 2B complete

**Issues Created:**
- None yet (GitHub remote setup still pending)

**Next Agent Should:**
- **PRIORITY 1:** Resolve Entity Framework Core 8.0.11 compatibility issue with SQLite provider (TypeLoadException on LockReleaseBehavior)
- **PRIORITY 2:** Implement Sorting Station interface (highest business value per user stories)
- Create basic Razor Pages structure for all 4 stations
- Add SignalR configuration for real-time updates
- Implement repository pattern interfaces and concrete implementations

**Blockers/Questions:**
- **CRITICAL:** EF Core SQLite provider compatibility issue preventing database initialization
- GitHub remote repository setup still needed for issue tracking
- Decision on specific UI components and styling framework for station interfaces

**Key Insights for Next Agent:**
- Solution builds successfully and ASP.NET Core starts correctly (tested with simplified Program.cs)
- All domain entities properly configured with enum support and relationship mapping
- Database seeding creates realistic sample data (1 work order, 2 products, 6 parts)
- Clean Architecture structure enables easy testing and future extension
- EF Core issue likely requires package version alignment or alternative approach

**Technical Notes:**
- All projects target .NET 8.0 with proper dependency flow
- Entity enums use string conversion for database storage
- Sample data represents realistic kitchen cabinet manufacturing workflow
- Database context configured for both SQLite (dev) and SQL Server (prod) support

**Time Spent:** 2 hours

- Updated project status to reflect 40% completion of requirements phase

**Files Created/Modified:**
- docs/requirements/business-requirements.md - Complete functional and non-functional requirements
- docs/requirements/user-stories.md - User stories for System Admin, Station Operators, Production Manager, QA
- docs/requirements/acceptance-criteria.md - Detailed testable criteria for all functional requirements
- docs/design/database-schema.sql - Complete relational schema with indexes, views, and initial data
- PROJECT_STATUS.md - Updated to reflect requirements documentation completion

**Issues Created:**
- None yet (GitHub remote setup still pending)

**Next Agent Should:**

**Key Insights for Next Agent:**
- Sorting station workflow is highest business priority (US-004, US-005)
- Storage rack flexibility is major improvement opportunity (unlimited vs current 6-rack limit)
- Database schema emphasizes audit trail and hierarchical data integrity
- All 4 stations need different interface contexts but shared data model

**Time Spent:** 2 hours
