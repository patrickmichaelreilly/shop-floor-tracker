# Development Guidelines

## Git Commit Standard for All Agents

### After Completing Any Phase:
1. **Review all files** you modified and ensure they're saved
2. **Stage all changes** using: `git add .`
3. **Commit with this exact message format:**
```
git commit -m "Phase X: [Description] - [Agent Name]

- [Key accomplishment 1]
- [Key accomplishment 2]
- [Key accomplishment 3]
- [Any important notes]
- [Database/UI/Architecture changes]

```

4. **CRITICAL: Push to GitHub immediately:**
```
git push origin master
```

5. **Verify the commit** using: `git log --oneline -1`

## Complete Git Workflow for All Agents

### Every commit must follow this COMPLETE process:

1. **Stage changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   # or git add specific-files
   ```

2. **Commit with proper format:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Phase X: Description - Claude Code"
   ```

3. **CRITICAL: Push to GitHub immediately:**
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

### Why All Three Steps Are Required:
- **Local commits are invisible** to other agents and tools until pushed
- **GitHub is the source of truth** for the project state
- **URL grabbing tools** read from GitHub, not local repository
- **Collaboration requires** changes to be on the remote repository

### Verification:
After pushing, verify your changes are visible on GitHub by:
- Checking the repository web interface
- Confirming the commit appears in the GitHub history
- Testing that any file changes are accessible via raw GitHub URLs

### Example:
```
git commit -m "Phase 2D: Database Integration & Sorting Station - Claude Code

- Resolved EF Core SQLite compatibility issue
- Replaced mock data with live database queries
- Fixed character encoding for navigation arrows
- Implemented basic Sorting Station functionality
- Database file (shopfloor.db) created with seeded data
- All existing UI and navigation preserved

### Multi-Agent Coordination:
- Always read `AGENT_HANDOFF_LOG.md` before starting
- Update `PROJECT_STATUS.md` with your progress
- Document any blockers or issues immediately
- Create clear handoff notes for the next agent

## File Ownership (Multi-Agent):
- Core files (Program.cs, .csproj): Single owner only
- Station pages: Each agent owns different stations
- Documentation: Separate sections per agent

## Development Process:
1. Read existing documentation and handoff logs
2. Use TodoWrite tool to plan your phase implementation
3. Implement changes systematically
4. Test functionality thoroughly
5. Commit using the standard format above
6. Update handoff documentation for next agent

This creates our self-reinforcing development process where each agent follows the same standards and leaves clear trails for collaboration.
